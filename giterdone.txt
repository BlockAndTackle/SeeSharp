this batch file does the following steps in a Git repo:
git add * // add all files that are changed or new etc
git commit -m "global repo changes added, committed, and pushed via giterdone.bat batch file" //commit the changes
git push origin master //push the changes to the master branch of the repo on the server...

this batch file needs to be copied to any repo folder in order to be used etc...
